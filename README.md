## Detailed Intstructions


**1 - ADD and VOTE on papers as comments in the** [voting issue](https://github.com/WideBot/nlp-reading-group/issues/1)

You may only put the title and the link to the paper, or add any comments to help people to understand why it is worth reading.

- You are not supposed to understand everything

**5- After discussion add your thoughts as a comment on the issue of the discussion day (NOT the voting issue)**
